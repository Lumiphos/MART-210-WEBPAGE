      <h2>My cat (1/2)</h2>
      <p>
                This is a picture of my cat Reese. We found her in a pipe and decided to keep her. She started small, but now she is a very large girl. 
                Her favorite things are scratches at the base of her tail, and eating. She loves begging for scraps when we're at the dinner table, but she won't steal food
                from people unless they give it to her. The only exception is bread; she will eat straight through plastic to get to bread. She is why we had to start locking 
                up our bread. She is a very calm cat otherwise, never hisses, never scratches, and never goes crazy for anything.

      <p>
                This is my rat, Oreo. No that is not a typo. She is feral. Her mother, Tommy, was a feral cat found in a dumpster by my mother's coworker, and Oreo has 
                inherited that craziness.
                She can leap 2 meters in the air without trying. She stopped ageing at some point, and has just been stuck looking like a teenager cat for months now.
                She has the zoomies 24/7. She WILL steal food. She fears NOTHING. She once tried to tightrope walk on a 2cm thick wood block dangling over a 8 foot drop.
                She does not gain weight, despite frequently stealing food from us. She has somehow learned how to meow in such a way that it sounds like a human with
                a croaky voice going "...Helloooo?" like something out of a horror movie. She is, pardon my language, absolutely batshit insane.
