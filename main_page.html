      <h2>My cat (1/2)</h2>
      <p>
                This is a picture of my cat Reese. We found her in a pipe and decided to keep her. She started small, but now she is a very large girl. 
                Her favorite things are scratches at the base of her tail, and eating. She loves begging for scraps when we're at the dinner table, but she won't steal food
                from people unless they give it to her. The only exception is bread; she will eat straight through plastic to get to bread. She is why we had to start locking 
                up our bread. She is a very calm cat otherwise, never hisses, never scratches, and never goes crazy for anything.

      <p>
                This is my rat, Oreo. No that is not a typo. She is feral. Her mother, Tommy, was a feral cat found in a dumpster by my mother's coworker, and Oreo has 
                inherited that craziness.
                She can leap 2 meters in the air without trying. She stopped ageing at some point, and has just been stuck looking like a teenager cat for months now.
                She has the zoomies 24/7. She WILL steal food. She fears NOTHING. She once tried to tightrope walk on a 2cm thick wood block dangling over a 8 foot drop.
                She does not gain weight, despite frequently stealing food from us. She has somehow learned how to meow in such a way that it sounds like a human with
                a croaky voice going "...Helloooo?" like something out of a horror movie. She is, pardon my language, absolutely batshit insane.

              Penelope is hungry between classes. She doesn't have her own car, so she would need to rely on the school's free transportation to go
              get food between classes. However, she doesn't want to use the free transportation, since it can be very unreliable, and she doesn't
              want to be late to her next class. Thankfully, Demeter Grocer is there to save her day. With Demeter Grocer, she is finally able to get food, without
              having that time cut into classes.

                   A paper prototype of the app, Demeter Grocer. There, you can search for food to buy. After selecting what you want to purchase, you can see what stores
                   near you sell that particular product, and even request a ride to that store through the app. You can view your profile where you can change the app's
                   appearance, and view your notifications. You can also favorite a particular product or shop, and view them under your Favorites tab. Through the
                   Favorites tab, you can also rate the app, or your drivers.
